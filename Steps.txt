The modification made:

1. fci() -> tfci():
	1. The original function is 'tpc()' from package tpc.R. 
	2. Change1: added a 'tier' parameter into the function. (85-121)
	3. (In Progress) Change2: Whether it is necessary to always use one of the conservative and
 		maj.rule. (line 141-145)
	4. Change3: change the 'pdsep()' into 'tpdsep()' inside the program. (line 191)
	6. Change4: (Line 1087-1095) maybe we can delete this part
	7. Change5: Insert 2 at amat[i,j] wherever there is an edge connecting to future at j to past 
		at i. Successfully fix the problem of future pointing to past in Change4. (Line 1117-1125)
	8. Change6: change the 'tpc.cons.intern' into 'tpc.cons.intern' inside the program. (line 217 & 232)

2. pdsep() -> tpdsep():
	1. The original function is 'pdsep()' from package pcalg.R.
	2. Change1: Added a 'tiers' parameter as a vector. Wrote a program to guarantee
		the input of 'tiers' vector is valid. (Line 39-50)

	3. Change2: In this step. It is trying to figure out the vertices which are not in the vector
 		diff.set. Create a vector named 'tiers.diff.set' as a proxy vector. Then, change the
 		tier values of the non-existing vertices to '-1' (tried changing to NULL, but a legal
 		syntax in R). An arrangement has been made for tier vector (NULL, NULL, NULL, ...,
 		NULL), if a 'tiers.diffset' consists of NULL elements only, it will be skipped (Line
 		127-141).


	4. Change3: The program is to skip the situation that max tier values in 'diff.set' is 
		greater than the maximum between vertex X and vertex Y. Since there are 3 different
 		'ord', the change should be applied to all the 3 different 'ord's'
		(Change3-1: Line 178-184)
		(Change3-2: Line 210-216)
		(Change3-3: Line 240-246)

	*********(Not Sure if the change in this part is correct or Not Yet)**********
	 
	5. Change4: The 'biCC' parameter and the its related code in the function have been
 		invalidated. (Line 144-158)

	6. Change5: If j is future to I, and there is an edge between i and j, change the head from I
 		to j to 2, and mark of edge on i side to 1. The modification should be done before
 		allpdsep <- lapply().(Line 72-84)


3. tskeleton() was the original function from the package tpc.R. Its original version was 'skeleton()' from package pcalg.R.

4. tcheckTriple() was the original function from the package tpc.R. Its original version was 'checkTriple' from package pcalg.R.

5. tpc.cons.intern() was the original function from package tpc.R. Its original version was 'pc.cons.intern' from package pcalg.R.

6. qreach() was the original function from pcalg.R.

Current step: trying to test the algorithm using different test cases. Up to now, there isn't any problem of future pointing to past. 

Difficulties: 1. Hard to manipulate the occurrence of colliders to create special test cases efficiently.
