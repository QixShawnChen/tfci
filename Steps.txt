The modification made:

1. fci() -> tfci():
	1. The original function is 'tpc()' from package tpc.R. 
	2. Change1: added a 'tier' parameter into the function. (869-905)
	3. (In Progress) Change2: Whether it is necessary to always use one of the conservative and maj.rule. (line 925-929)
	4. Change3: change the 'pdsep()' into 'tpdsep()' inside the program. (line 955)
	5. Change4: (Maybe) need a change 'pdsep()' to 'tpdsep()'. (line 975)

2. pdsep() -> tpdsep():
	1. The original function is 'pdsep()' from package pcalg.R.
	2. (In progress) Change1: Need to write a program to further exclude the impossible d-seps.
		Basically I am trying to add a parameter 'tiers'. It is a vector assigning a tier number for each node in the graph. 
	3. Change2: the 'biCC' parameter and the its related code in the function have been invalidated. 

3. tskeleton() was the original function from the package tpc.R. Its original version was 'skeleton()' from package pcalg.R.
