The modifications made:

1. fci() -> tfci():
	1. Based on the function 'tpc()' from package tpc.R @ https://github.com/bips-hb/tpc 
	2. Change1: added a 'tier' parameter into the function and related validity checks. (~78-123)
	3. Change2: changed 'skeleton()' to 'tskeleton()'. (line 159)
	4. Change3: changed 'pdsep()' into 'tpdsep()'. (line 179)
	5. Change4: changed 'pc.cons.intern()' into 'tpc.cons.intern(). (lines 202 and 217) 
	6. Change5: Insert arrowhead (2) at amat[i,j] wherever there is an edge connecting to future at j to past 
		at i.  Created a G1 as the copy of G, though keeping original G is probably not necessary. (line 239-248)
	

2. pdsep() -> tpdsep():
	1. The original function is 'pdsep()' from package pcalg.R.
	2. Change1: Added a 'tiers' parameter as a vector. Wrote checks to guarantee
		the input of 'tiers' vector is valid. (Line 39-50)
	3. Change2: In this step. It is trying to figure out the vertices which are not in the vector
 		diff.set. Create a vector named 'tiers.diff.set' as a proxy vector. Then, change the
 		tier values of the non-existing vertices to '-1' (tried changing to NULL, but a legal
 		syntax in R). An arrangement has been made for tier vector (NULL, NULL, NULL, ...,
 		NULL), if a 'tiers.diffset' consists of NULL elements only, it will be skipped (Line
 		127-141).
	4. Change3: The program is to skip the situation that max tier values in 'diff.set' is 
		greater than the maximum between vertex X and vertex Y. Since there are 3 different
 		'ord', the change should be applied to all the 3 different 'ord's'
		(Change3-1: Line 178-184)
		(Change3-2: Line 210-216)
		(Change3-3: Line 240-246)

	*********(Not Sure if the change in this part is correct or Not Yet)**********
	 
	5. Change4: The 'biCC' parameter and the its related code in the function have been
 		invalidated. (Line 144-158)

	6. Change5: If j is future to i, and there is an edge between i and j, change the mark from i
 		to j to 2, and mark of edge on i side to 1. The modification should be done before
 		allpdsep <- lapply().(Line 72-84)


3. tskeleton() is the original function from the package tpc.R. Its original version was 'skeleton()' from package pcalg.R.

4. tcheckTriple() is the original function from the package tpc.R. Its original version was 'checkTriple' from package pcalg.R.

5. tpc.cons.intern() is the original function from package tpc.R. Its original version was 'pc.cons.intern' from package pcalg.R.


Current step: trying to test the algorithm using different test cases. Up to now, there hasn't been any problem of future pointing to past. 
	Case1, Case2, and Case3 have been included in the test file.
