The modifications made:

1. fci() -> tfci():
	0. Based on the function 'tpc()' from package tpc.R @ https://github.com/bips-hb/tpc 
	1. Change1: added a 'tier' parameter into the function and related validity checks. (~78-123)
	2. Change2: changed 'skeleton()' to 'tskeleton()'. (line 159)
	3. Change3: changed 'pdsep()' into 'tpdsep()'. (line 179)
	4. Change4: changed 'pc.cons.intern()' into 'tpc.cons.intern(). (lines 202 and 217) 
	5. Change5: Insert arrowhead (2) at amat[i,j] wherever there is an edge connecting future at j to past 
		at i.  Created a G1 as the copy of G, though keeping original G is probably not necessary. (lines 239-248)
	

2. pdsep() -> tpdsep():
	0. The original function is 'pdsep()' from package pcalg.R. The point of the modification is that it is not necessary to consider conditioning sets in the future of vertices (i,j).
	1. Change1: Added a 'tiers' parameter as a vector. Wrote checks to guarantee
		the input of 'tiers' vector is valid. (lines 39-50)
	2. Change2: Insert arrowhead (2) at amat[i,j] wherever there is an edge connecting future at j to past at i. Similar to Change5 		in tfci() above. The modification should be done before allpdsep <- lapply(). (lines 72-82)
	3. Change3: In this step the function is trying to figure out the vertices that are not in the vector
 		diff.set. Created a vector named 'tiers.diff.set'. Changed the
 		tier values of the excluded vertices to '-1'. An arrangement has been made for tier vector (NULL, NULL, NULL, ...,
 		NULL), if a 'tiers.diffset' consists of NULL elements only, it will be skipped (Line
 		125-139).
	4. Change4: The 'biCC' parameter and the its related code in the function have been
 		commented out. (lines 57-58, 142-156)
	5. Change5: Here the function skips the considered conditioning set if max tier values in 'diff.set' is 
		greater than the maximum between vertex i and vertex j. Since there are 3 different
 		'ord', the change should be applied to all the 3 different 'ord's'
		(Change5-1: Line 176-182)
		(Change5-2: Line 208-214)
		(Change5-3: Line 238-244)


3. tskeleton() is the original function from the package tpc.R. Its original version was 'skeleton()' from package pcalg.R.

4. tcheckTriple() is the original function from the package tpc.R. Its original version was 'checkTriple' from package pcalg.R.

5. tpc.cons.intern() is the original function from package tpc.R. Its original version was 'pc.cons.intern' from package pcalg.R.


Current step: trying to test the algorithm using different test cases. Up to now, there hasn't been any problem of future pointing to past. 
	Case1, Case2, and Case3 have been included in the test file.
